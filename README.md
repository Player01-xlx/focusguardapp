## 🧠 Why FocusGuard Exists

**The Productivity Crisis is Real:**
- 88% of people struggle with procrastination daily
- The average knowledge worker checks email every 3 minutes
- Traditional Pomodoro apps don't adapt to your unique patterns
- Generic productivity tools ignore the science of individual focus rhythms

**The Problem:** Every person's brain works differently. Your peak focus hours aren't the same as mine. Your optimal session length changes based on stress, sleep, and countless other factors. Yet every productivity app treats all users identically.

**The Missing Piece:** What if your productivity tool could learn from your behavior, predict your optimal work times, and adapt its recommendations to match your unique patterns? What if it could warn you before a productivity crash and guide you toward your peak performance windows?

That's why FocusGuard exists.
